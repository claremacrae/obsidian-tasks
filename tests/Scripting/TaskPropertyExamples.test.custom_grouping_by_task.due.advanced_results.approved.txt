Results of custom groupers



group by function task.due.moment?.fromNow() || ""
Group by the time from now, for example "8 days ago".
Because Moment.fromNow() is not provided by TasksDate, we need special code for when there is no date value.
Whilst interesting, the alphabetical sort order makes the headings a little hard to read
=>
10 days ago
11 days ago
12 days ago

group by function task.due.moment ? ( task.due.moment.day() === 0 ? task.due.format("[%%][8][%%]dddd") : task.due.format("[%%]d[%%]dddd") ) : "Undated"
Group by day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc).
The day names are sorted in date order, starting with Monday.
Tasks without due dates are displayed at the end, under a heading "Undated".
This is best understood by pasting it in to a Tasks block in Obsidian and then deleting parts of the expression.
The key technique is to say that if the day is Sunday (`0`), then force it to be displayed as date number `8`, so it comes after the other days of the week
=>
%%2%%Tuesday
%%3%%Wednesday
%%4%%Thursday
Invalid date
Undated

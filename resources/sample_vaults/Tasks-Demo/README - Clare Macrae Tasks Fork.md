# README - Clare Macrae Tasks Fork

## Summary

- This **development** build of the Obsidian Tasks plugin is from Clare Macrae's development fork:
  - <https://github.com/claremacrae/obsidian-tasks>
- It is based on the Tasks **1.19.0** release, so **does not contain all the latest official Tasks features**.

## Experimental features, not in Tasks

The following are features I have implemented for my own use. This is the Tasks version I use on my own vault.

I am confident that the code is well tested.

But I **make no promise that any of the features here will make it in to the Core Tasks**, nor that this version will be kept up to date with new features in the core Tasks plugin.

So you **should not rely on new features here in your own vault**.

## Experimental Features - for Feedback

- [[Experimental - Custom Task States]]
- [[Experimental - Run Tasks commands in Javascript]]
- [[Experimental - Show and Hide Tags]]
